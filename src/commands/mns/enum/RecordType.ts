  '*'=255,	       //RFC 1035[1]	All cached records	Returns all records of all types known to the name server. If the name server does not have any information on the name, the request will be forwarded on. The records returned may not be complete. For example, if there is both an A and an MX for a name, but the name server has only the A record cached, only the A record will be returned. Usually referred to as ANY (e.g., in dig, Windows nslookup, and Wireshark). In 2019, RFC8482 [14] standards-track publication led many DNS providers, including Cloudflare,[15] to provide only minimal responses to "ANY" queries, instead of enumerating records.

  'IXFR'=251,	       //RFC 1996	Incremental Zone Transfer	Requests a zone transfer of the given zone but only differences from a previous serial number. This request may be ignored and a full (AXFR) sent in response if the authoritative server is unable to fulfill the request due to configuration or lack of required deltas.
  'OPT'=41,	       //RFC 6891	Option	This is a pseudo-record type needed to support EDNS.
